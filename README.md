Detekt
======

Compiling
---------

In order to compile Detekt, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 2.7.x
- Yara wity Python bindings (latest version available)
- Pywin32
- PyQt4

Once all the dependencies are installed, you should be able to just run the ``make.bat`` file,
which will take care of launching PyInstaller and generating a Windows executable in the *dist/*
folder.
